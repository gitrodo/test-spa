# TestSpa

## Challenge
Develop a SPA using Angular that consumes any real time data stream (for examples see https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/), performs some aggregation of the data and displays the aggregate values on the page.

We encourage using a state management library like ngrx, ngxs, or Akita.  We ask that you prepare and publish this work on GitHub, StackBlitz, or equivalent, viewable to us. Please do not include the name Swimlane in your project.

## Example
Build a web application that consumes the twitter data stream, filters by a user supplied hash tag, and displays the average number of tweets per minute as well as a sample of the country code of origin.

Again, we hope this challenge is interesting and will provoke a higher level of discussion as we continue this process.  If you have any constraints in regard to completing this challenge feel free to contact us.
